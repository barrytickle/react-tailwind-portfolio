# Crator - HTML

A modern dark agency theme built with Tailwind CSS

## Getting started

We have shipped this template using the Tailwind CLI tool in order to get you up and running as fast as possible.

If you would like to setup a development environment with hot reloading, first ensure that Node.js & npm are installed. This theme uses the latest version of Tailwind: tailwindcss v3.3.

First, install the dependencies by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and run

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install  # if you have Yarn installed
```

This will install all the required dependencies and place them in a folder called `node_modules` in the root directory.

We have added the compiled CSS file to the `<head>` of all the template's HTML files so if you want to rebuild Tailwindâ€™s utility classes to style your content, you simply run the Tailwind CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and rebuild your CSS. We have wrapped the Tailwind CLI tool in a npm script, that way you can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the Tailwind CLI in watch mode, that way the `build/css/main.css` file will rebuild everytime you make changes to your HTML files. You can also run

```
npm run build
```

to build your CSS for production and minify your stylesheet.

## Tailwind CSS

This theme is built on top of the Tailwind CSS framework which is installed via npm and used via the Tailwind CLI tool as recommended by the offical Tailwind installation docs (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). If you are not familiar with the Tailwind CSS framework I would recommend you check out the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

The entrypoint css file is located at `src/tailwind.css`. This file contains the `@tailwind` directives.

We've tried to minimize any custom CSS and only rely on Tailwind's utility classes and a few additional classes defined within the `tailwind.config.js` file. This template additionally uses 1 official Tailwind plugin: `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`).

## Build directory

The bulk of the code is located in the `build` directory. Here you will find all of the `html` files at the root of the directory, the images (`build/images`), and the CSS build file after running the Tailwind CLI tool (`build/css/main.css`).

## Javascript

As for JavaScript we are only using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for the mobile navigation. We have installed Alpine.js by including its CDN in a `<script>` tag in in the head of our HTML pages.

## Font

This template uses the `Inter` Font family from the [Google Fonts Library](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). The font is imported in the `src/tailwind.css` stylesheet.
